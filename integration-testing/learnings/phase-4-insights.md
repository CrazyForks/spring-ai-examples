## Patterns & Anti-Patterns üîÑ

### Effective Patterns ‚ú®
1. **Layered Documentation Architecture**: Basic info in main files, detailed guides in docs/ subdirectories
2. **Template-Driven Configuration**: Standardized templates reduce configuration errors and improve consistency  
3. **Quick Reference + Deep Dive**: Troubleshooting guide provides both immediate fixes and thorough analysis
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Implementation summary bridges technical details with strategic insights
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build on existing documentation rather than replacing it wholesale

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Documentation Duplication**: Avoid repeating the same information across multiple files
2. **Over-Technical Main Docs**: Keep CLAUDE.md accessible, move complex details to specialized guides
3. **Template Rigidity**: Provide templates as starting points, not rigid requirements
4. **Knowledge Silos**: Ensure learnings are synthesized and accessible, not buried in phase-specific documents
